README for Outer Div with Padding and Inner Div in HTML with CSS
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This README provides instructions on how to create an outer `<div>` with padding applied, resulting in padding between the edge of the outer div and the edge of the inner div. Follow these steps to set up and visualize the padding effect:

1. HTML Structure:
   - Begin by opening the HTML file where you want to create the outer and inner divs.
   - Inside the `<body>` element, create the outer `<div>` element.
   - Within the outer `<div>`, create the inner `<div>` element.
   - Add any desired content or elements within the inner `<div>`.

2. CSS Styling:
   - Open your CSS file or create a new one.
   - Select the outer `<div>` and apply desired styling. For example:
     ```css
     #outerDiv {
       padding: 20px;
       /* Additional styles for the outer div */
     }
     ```
   - Customize the styles further by adding properties like background color, border, or other desired attributes.

3. Apply CSS to HTML:
   - In your HTML file, link the CSS file by adding the following line of code within the `<head>` section:
     ```html
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/your/css-file.css">
     ```
   - Replace `"path/to/your/css-file.css"` with the actual path to your CSS file.

4. Add Outer and Inner Divs to HTML:
   - In your HTML file, within the `<body>` section, add the outer and inner `<div>` elements. For example:
     ```html
     <div id="outerDiv">
       <div id="innerDiv">
         <!-- Add your content or elements here -->
       </div>
     </div>
     ```

5. Save and Preview:
   - Save both your HTML and CSS files.
   - Open the HTML file in a web browser to see the outer `<div>` with padding applied, resulting in padding between the edge of the outer div and the edge of the inner div.

Congratulations! You have successfully created and styled an outer `<div>` with padding and an inner `<div>` in HTML using CSS. The padding applied to the outer div creates space between its edge and the edge of the inner div. Feel free to customize the padding value, add additional styles, or incorporate any desired features to suit your project's requirements.
